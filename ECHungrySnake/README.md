#HungrySnake By: Juntong

*Compile:
make -f makefile.macosx

*Run:
./snakegame

*Rules:
1. The list of green blocks is our Snake, and the light green block is its head, dark blocks, body. 
2. Move Snake with e,d,s,f. 
3. Snake initially has three blocks, whenever it eats an apple (the red block), it gains another block. 
4. Another new apple appears randomly every time when the old one is eaten. 
5. Please do not let the Snake eat itself or hit the wall, it will die immediately :( 

*Keys:
g - Start
e - Move up
d - Move down
s - Move left
f - Move right
q - Quit

*There're several things, such as OpenGL and srand time, in this program that we didn't learn in lectures, so I searched on Google for help.
