# CS 16 Extra Credit Project
Extra credit project that showcases the concepts learned in CS 16.

To submit your project:
* Fork this repo
* Clone *your fork* of this repo
* Make your changes in that repo
* Commit your changes
* Push your changes (to the forked repo that you cloned above)

Whenever you are ready to submit your extra credit, submit a pull request through the GitHub.com interface.

Make sure that you update the documentation inside `main.cpp`. If you have more than one file to submit,
make sure that each file uses the same format and provides that documentation. Additionally, if you have
several files, ensure that your Makefile allows us to properly compile each project.

Feel free to update your repo's README to provide high-level overview of the project and your 
motivation for creating it (other than a grade ;-)).
